# QBinDiff's documentation!

This is the documentation of QBinDiff (temporary name).
This will be updated in the future.

## Project Overview

QBinDiff is an experimental diffing tool based on the **Network Alignement Quadratic Problem**.

For an general introduction you can see the slides of the 23/09/2022 fridaycon [here](https://diffing.doc.qb/communications/2022-09-23_qbindiff_fridaycon/pres.pdf)

For an in-depth description of the algorithm read **Elie Mengin**'s PhD thesis
