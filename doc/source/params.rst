Parameters
==========

The :py:class:`differ object <qbindiff.QBinDiff>` requires several parameters to compute the matching. These parameters are chosen by the user, which makes QBinDiff highly modular.

Distances
---------

A distance is used to measure the distance (hence the similarity) between the feature vectors. Choosing a different distance could lead to different behaviors.
Note that some features are performing better with a specific distance metric, for example the :py:class:`Weisfeiler Lehman Graph Kernel <qbindiff.features.WeisfeilerLehman>` works best with the :py:class:`cosine <qbindiff.Distance.cosine>` similarity.

Most of the distance functions that QBinDiff uses come from `Scipy <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/spatial.distance.html>`_. These distances are computed between two 1-D arrays. Candidate distances are then:

* braycurtis
* canberra
* chebyshev
* cityblock
* correlation
* cosine
* euclidean
* mahalanobis
* minkowski
* seuclidean
* sqeuclidean

However, some distance are unique in QBinDiff, such as the haussmann distance.
This is a experimental new metric that combines the jaccard index and the canberra distance.

Haussmann
~~~~~~~~~

Formally it is defined as:

.. math::
   d(u, v) = 
   \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } \forall i \; u_i = 0 \land v_i = 0 \\
    1 - \sum_{i=0}^n\frac{f(u_i, v_i)}{ \lvert \{ j | u_j \neq 0 \lor v_j \neq 0 \} \rvert } & \text{otherwise}
   \end{cases}

.. math::
   with\ u, v \in \mathbb{R}^n

where the function `f` is defined like this:

.. math::
   f(x, y) = 
   \begin{cases}
    0 & \text{if } x = 0 \lor y = 0 \\
    1 - \frac{|x - y|}{|x| + |y|} & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}


Epsilon
-------

.. TODO write the section ^^

This is epsilon relaxation. Refer to the Elie Mengin's :download:`thesis <_static/thesis.pdf>` to know more about it.


Tradeoff
--------

QBinDiff relies on two aspects of a binary/graph: either the **similarity** (between functions or nodes) or the **structure** provided by the *Call Graph*, also known as the **topology** of the binary.

The **similarity** is computed with a distance over a linear combination of several :ref:`features <features>` that usually depend on the function attributes. On the contrary, the **structure** is directly linked on the underlying graphs that come from the binary.

The *tradeoff parameter* is the weight associated to the importance to give to the similarity or the structure.
If the tradeoff is equal to 0, then the algorithm relies exclusively on the topology to diff the binaries. If instead
it's equal to 1, then solely the similarity is used.

..  warning::

    Some features (like :py:class:`ChildNb <qbindiff.features.ChildNb>` or :py:class:`GraphCommunities <qbindiff.features.GraphCommunities>`) might also consider the call graph topology, so even if you set the the tradeoff to 1 you still might end up considering the topology to some extent.

Normalization
-------------

The normalization of the *Call Graph* is an optional step that aims at simplifying it to produce better results when diffing two binaries.

It simplify the graph by removing thunk functions, i.e. functions that are just trampolines to another function; they usually are just made of a single `JMP` instruction.

Removing thunk functions has the benefit of reducing the size of the binary, hence improving the efficiency and the accuracy.

Reverse-engineers are usually interested in matching more interesting functions rather than thunk functions, that's why enabling the normalization pass might be beneficial.

A custom normalization pass can also be set by subclassing :py:class:`QBinDiff <qbindiff.QBinDiff>` and overriding the method :py:meth:`~qbindiff.QBinDiff.normalize`.

..  warning::
    In some cases, the normalization may lead to a bug with the BinExport backend. This is due to some specificities of BinExport protobuf file. This may be fixed in the future. 

Sparsity
--------

.. TODO: add sparsity matrix image for clarification

If both programs have a larger number of functions, the combinatorial between functions for the similarity
might be troublesome (time and memory-wise).

There is usually no need to use the entire similarity matrix as each function will only be `similar` to a small
subset of candidates. Hence, to save memory and to make QBinDiff run faster it's better to emptying part of that matrix.

You can set the required *density* of the similarity matrix with the **sparsity ratio** that goes from 0 to 1:

- The closer to 0, the more information is kept. The matrix will be bigger, the matching slower but more accurate
- The closer to 1 the less information is kept. The matrix will be smaller, the computation faster but results might
  be less accurate.

..  warning::
    If your binaries are large (~10k functions) and your RAM is limited, running QBinDiff with a low sparsity ratio may lead to a out-of-memory error. In that case, consider increasing the sparsity ratio (even values like 0.9 or 0.99 are usually perfectly fine).
